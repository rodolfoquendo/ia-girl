# Git safety (CRITICAL — read every session)

**DO NOT MESS WITH GIT.** DO NOT run `git checkout`, `git stash`, `git reset`, `git restore`,
`git clean`, or any command that discards or overwrites working-tree changes. These repos often
carry large amounts of **uncommitted** work, and these commands will destroy it irreversibly.

If you need to change the current branch: **commit the work first, or ask the user to commit.**
Never revert, discard, or overwrite changes via git without explicit permission from the user.

## NEVER TOUCH `insignia-education/infra/envs`

**Read-only. Never create, edit, move, or delete anything under
`insignia-education/infra/envs/` — not one line, for any reason.**

That directory is the owner's personal record of the deployed environments,
kept manually on their machine. It is gitignored, so there is no history and
**nothing there can be recovered from git.** A prod env file was already lost
once this way.

- Need to know what a deployed env contains? Read it, don't write it.
- An env var needs to change? Say so and let the owner make the edit.
- Recovering a lost env: the deploy pipeline stores the authoritative copy in
  AWS SSM Parameter Store (e.g. `/ie/api/env-prod`), and the EC2 host holds a
  `chmod 600` copy at the deploy's `ENV_FILE_PATH`. Restore from SSM, and hand
  the file to the owner rather than writing into `envs/` yourself.
